title: Grains sequence

When putting the system's design together, flexibility in processing tasks or grains has always been a top priority. 

Digital Silo lets developers define their grains' execution behavior by populating specific fields in the grains' payloads' metadata section. Digital Silo adopts the instructed pattern according to the grains' metadata. As a result, it runs some grains without any particular order, queues another set of grains, or defers processing another batch of grains. 

Please refer to this section of the documentation for further technical details.

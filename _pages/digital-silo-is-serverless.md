Digital Silo harnesses the power of the Azure cloud to supercharge the execution of the business logic encapsulated in submitted grains. It can well scale-out when additional horsepower is needed or provide a close to real-time processing time and throughput. Digital Silo can accommodate hundreds or thousands of grains simultaneously without any compromise!
